---------- TICKET 001
Title    : TinyStories Corpus
Status   : TESTING
    Need to be able to select corpus in config wizard.
    No backwards compat required.
    Need to verify this actually works.
----------

---------- TICKET 016
Title    : Create "findings" document
Status   : PENDING
    Use this to capture all of my findings. This should only be the results of actual findings I make. Currently the only real finding is about weight tying and requiring an output linear projection to allow for effective training.
----------

---------- TICKET 003
Title    : Reorg files
Status   : PENDING
    Scripts should be in scripts.
    Remove midtraining and finetuning scripts.
    Remove "dev" which I don't think is needed.
    Move documents into a new "docs" folder
----------

---------- TICKET 007
Title    : Model size calculation scripts
Status   : PENDING
    Scripts to calculate potential model size based on parameters.
    It should also calculate training time based on token ratio and some rough estimations based on actual training times.
----------

---------- TICKET 008
Title    : Queue processing script
Status   : PENDING
    Script which will take run names as command-line parameters and process each one sequentially. Before processing, will do simple validation to make sure runs exist and have not run yet, and to make sure there are no duplicates in the parameters.
    The script does `set_run.sh ${current_run} && start_run.sh` on each run.
    It should also set the title of the screen, using:
    ` echo -en "\033]0;Your Desired Title\a" `
    That should include run number as well: ${current} of ${total}
    If a run fails, it should create a file like "run_failed" in the run directory.
----------

---------- TICKET 009
Title    : Update parameter calculations
Status   : PENDING
    Include tied weights twice when calculating flops. Only include transformer block weights in token ratio calculation.
----------

---------- TICKET 019
Title    : Save "transformer" parameter size in report
Status   : PENDING
----------

---------- TICKET 018
Title    : Calculate optimal run sizes
Status   : PENDING
    Once wandb logging is fixed, it'll be trivial to determine optimal run sizes as long as we do several different runs.
----------

---------- TICKET 004
Title    : Parameterize activation function
Status   : PENDING
    Allow for different activation functions. This should be a string
    parameter to allow for many different ones
----------

---------- TICKET 005
Title    : Parameterize attention head size
Status   : PENDING
    Allow different attention head sizes
----------

---------- TICKET 006
Title    : Parameterize FFN expansion ratio
Status   : PENDING
    Allow different expansion ratios. Presumably larger expansion ratios (like 6:1) will yield better results (when controlling for total parameter count).
----------

---------- TICKET 020
Title    : Calculate optimal hyperparameters
Status   : PENDING
----------

---------- TICKET 011
Title    : Create corpus size calculator
Status   : PENDING
    Calculates corpus size in tokens. Creates .meta file for each parquet file which caches the token size for quick lookup. The meta file captures the timestamp of the parquet file, and if they don't match, then the meta file is recalculated.
---------- TICKET 010
Title    : Create corpus mixer
Status   : PENDING
    Script which takes corpora and mixes them by a given ratio.
    Depends on [011]
----------

---------- TICKET 015
Title    : Change default context window size
Status   : PENDING
    ... to 1024. Need to perform tests to see if we need any changes in corpus to support this...
----------

---------- TICKET 017
Title    : Get "1 billion token challenge" dataset
Status   : PENDING
    Get the training corpus. Details here: https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/optimal-dataset-mixing
----------

---------- TICKET 012
Title    : Add "confidence" head.
Status   : PENDING
    Add a scalar confidence head, which is trained based on the difference of expected token embedding and actual embedding.
---------- TICKET 013
Title    : Confidence head completion tool
Status   : PENDING
    Since confidence is separate from the text itself, we need a way to run completions and see their confidence. Maybe hack mikupad to show confidence per token?
    Depends on [012] of course.
