Title    : Actually save num_heads and num_kv_heads in config scripts; propagate them through the system
Status   : PENDING

Title    : Calculate optimal run sizes
Status   : IN PROGRESS
    Once wandb logging is fixed, it'll be trivial to determine optimal run sizes as long as we do several different runs.

Title    : Calculate optimal hyperparameters
Status   : PENDING

---------- TICKET 011
Title    : Create corpus size calculator
Status   : PENDING
    Calculates corpus size in tokens. Creates .meta.json file for each parquet file which caches the token size for quick lookup. The meta file captures the timestamp of the parquet file, and if they don't match, then the meta file is recalculated.
---------- TICKET 010
Title    : Create corpus mixer
Status   : PENDING
    Script which takes corpora and mixes them by a given ratio.
    Depends on [011]
----------

---------- TICKET 015
Title    : Change default context window size
Status   : PENDING
    ... to 1024. Need to perform tests to see if we need any changes in corpus to support this...
----------

---------- TICKET 017
Title    : Get "1 billion token challenge" dataset
Status   : PENDING
    Get the training corpus. Details here: https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/optimal-dataset-mixing

---------- TICKET 001
Title    : TinyStories Corpus
Status   : TESTING - ON HOLD
    Need to be able to select corpus in config wizard.
    No backwards compat required.
    Need to verify this actually works.

---------- TICKET 012
Title    : Add "confidence" head.
Status   : PENDING
    Add a scalar confidence head, which is trained based on the difference of expected token embedding and actual embedding.
---------- TICKET 013
Title    : Confidence head completion tool
Status   : PENDING
    Since confidence is separate from the text itself, we need a way to run completions and see their confidence. Maybe hack mikupad to show confidence per token?
    Depends on [012] of course.

---------- TICKET 030
Title    : Gating
Status   : PENDING
    Add another parameter, "gated", which when true, adds a separate up_proj matrix which gets element-wise multiplied before going through the down_proj matrix. Maybe it should be named to "gate_signal"
----------

---------- TICKET 031
Title    : Biases
Status   : PENDING
    Add another parameter, "enable_bias" or something like that, which enables biases for basically all matrices (unless there are any that don't make sense?)
